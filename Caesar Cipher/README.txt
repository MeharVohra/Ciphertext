This code performs encryption and decryption of a message based on the user's choice.

The user is prompted to input whether they want to encrypt (e) or decrypt (d) the message. This choice is stored in the e_or_d variable.

The user is prompted to enter the encryption/decryption key, which is an integer between 0 and 25. This value is stored in the key variable.

The user is prompted to enter the message they want to encrypt or decrypt. This value is stored in the message variable.

The encrypted_message and decrypted_message lists are created to store the encrypted and decrypted messages, respectively.

The code checks if the key value is 0. If it is, the original message is printed as the encrypted/decrypted message.

If the key value is less than 0 or greater than 25, the code prints an error message, "Key not acceptable!\nPlease enter the key (0 to 25) to use:".

If the key value is between 0 and 25, the code checks the value of e_or_d.

If e_or_d is "e", the code splits the message into words and stores it in the message_list list.

For each word in message_list, the code converts each character to its ASCII value, adds the key value to it, converts the new ASCII value back to a character, and stores the result in a new string called encrypted_word.

The code then appends each encrypted_word to the encrypted_message list.

Finally, the encrypted_message list is joined into a string and printed as the encrypted message.

If e_or_d is "d", the code performs the decryption process in the same way, but subtracts the key value from each character's ASCII value instead of adding it.

The decrypted message is printed as a string.
